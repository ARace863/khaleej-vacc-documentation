## Pilots flying without SLOTS

All pilots participating in the event must reserve a slot through [CTL Slot Booking](https://ctl.vatsim.me/cross-the-land-westbound-2025/bookings).

## Flight Plan

Pilots must adhere to the designated route assigned for their flight and avoid taking shortcuts without prior ATC approval. Deviating from the assigned route may affect their estimated time of arrival (ETA) and could lead to the forfeiture of their allocated arrival slot.

Additionally, pilots are reminded to ensure their navigation database is updated to the latest Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) cycle.
