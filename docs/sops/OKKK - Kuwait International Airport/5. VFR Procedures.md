The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for VFR Operations at Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)

---

## 5.1 Outbound VFR Traffic

VFR departures should be given departure instructions, including turn directions and leg to exit the circuit (if appropriate), and altitude.
Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: VFR aircraft shall be assigned an SSR code and taxied to their assigned runway (with concurrence of Tower) and shall receive departure instructions from Tower prior to departure.

Aircraft may request either touch and go, a stop and go, a low approach, or a full stop.

Once the Tower Controller is aware of the aircraftâ€™s intentions within the control zone, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

The following information should be provided prior to joining the circuit:
- Leg to join;
- Expected runway;
- Sequence;
- Any applicable traffic information

Zone Entry/Exit Points

| **Direction** | **Name** |
|---|---|
| North | Al Saji Island |
| East | Salmiya |
| West | Al Sabah Racecourse |
| South | Ahmadi |

>Pilot - "9K-SAA with you Apron 3 with information A on board, aircraft type C172 request clearance to leave the zone to the South"
>Controller - "9K-SAA Good Afternoon, cleared to leave the zone to the south via Ahmadi not above altitude 2000ft VFR, squawk 1011"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, cleared to leave the zone to the south via Ahmadi, not above altitude 2000ft VFr, squawk 1011.
>Controller - "9K-SAA, readback correct information A is current QNH 1019 advise when ready for engine start"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, wilco"

**Once airborne:**

>Controller - "9K-SAA, report overhead Ahmadi"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, wilco"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, overhead Ahmadi 2000ft"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, you are leaving the control zone monitor advisory on 122.800"

## 5.2 Inbound VFR Traffic
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be sent to ADC with enough time such that two-way radio communications have been established before aircraft receive clearance to enter the aerodrome control zone.

On initial contact, ADC will pass the instructions for joining the circuit, as well as any other pertinent information such as traffic information with the sector.

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone and instructed to hold outside of the CTR awaiting further instructions. Once a slot has been coordinated with the radar controllers, VFR arrivals may proceed, however, the estimated delay must be given to the pilot.

>Pilot - "9K-SAA, with you 19nm west of the airfield request clearance to enter the control zone"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, good afternoon, cleared to enter the control zone via Alsabah Racecourse not above altitude 2000ft VFR, Squawk 1057"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, cleared to enter the control zone via Alsabah Racecourse not above altitude 2000ft VFR, squawk 1057"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, read back is correct QNH 1019 report overhead Alsabah Racecourse with intentions"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, QNH 1019 wilco"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, overhead Alsabah Racecourse 2000ft request to enter the VFR traffic pattern"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, cleared to enter the right hand visual circuit RWY15R not above altitude 1000ft VFR, report downwind"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA, cleared to enter the right hand visual circuit RWY15R not above altitude 1000ft VFR, we will report downwind for RWY15R"

## 5.3 Traffic remaining in VFR Circuit
::::caution
VFR Circuits at OKKK (Kuwait International Airport) are carried out only on 33R and 15R in Right hand circuits.
::::

| **Runway Config** | **Runway** | **Circuit Direction** | **Altitude (Piston)** | **Altitude (Jet)** |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 33s | 33R | Right-Hand | 1000ft | 2000ft |
| 15s | 15R | Right-Hand | 1000ft | 2000ft |

Below is a Standard tranmission sequence for an aircraft planning for VFR Circuits from start to finish.

>Pilot - "9K-SAA Information A on board QNH1019, aircraft type C172 request VFR Circuits"
>Controller - "9K-SAA you are cleared right hand circuits RWY15R not above altitude 1000ft VFR, squawk 0667"
>Pilot - "Cleared right hand circuits RWY15R not above altitude 1000ft VFR, squawk 0667"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, read back correct information A is current QNH 1019 advise when ready for engine start"
>Pilot - "9K-SAA wilco"

>Pilot - "Ready for Startup, 9K-SAA"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, Startup Approved, Report ready for taxi"
>Pilot - "Request Taxi, 9K-SAA"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, Taxi to Holding Point 15R via E, E9, W14, W1, W4"
>Pilot - "Taxi to Holding Point 15R via E, E9, W14, W1, W4, 9K-SAA"

>Controller - "9K-SAA, right hand turn out RWY15R cleared for takeoff surface wind 070@6kts"
>Pilot - "Right hand turn out, Cleared for take off RWY15R"

**Once the pilot has turned onto the crosswind leg:**

>Controller - "9K-SAA, report downwind with intentions"
>Pilot - "Wilco, 9K-SAA"

**Downwind:**

>Pilot - "9K-SAA reporting downwind request touch and go RWY15R"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, report final you're number 1"

**Final:**

>Pilot - "9K-SAA, final RWY15R"
>Controller - "9K-SAA, cleared touch and go RWY15R surface wind 070@6kts"
