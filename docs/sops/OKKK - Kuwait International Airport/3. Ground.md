The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Ground Operations at Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)

## 2.1 General Provisions

Kuwait Ground **(OKBK_GND)** or Surface Movement Control **(SMC)** is responsible for managing surface operations at Kuwait International Airport. The SMC controller’s callsign for radio communication and coordination is “KUWAIT GROUND.” Their primary duties include overseeing aircraft pushback, engine startup, repositioning, and taxiing on the airport’s surface.

The SMC controller plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient ground operations. This involves coordinating movements to prevent congestion on taxiways and managing the flow of traffic during busy periods. If necessary, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be employed to optimize the sequencing of departures and maintain overall operational efficiency.
