The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Ground Operations at Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)

## 3.1 General Provisions

Kuwait Ground **(OKBK_GND)** or Surface Movement Control **(SMC)** is responsible for managing surface operations at Kuwait International Airport. The SMC controller’s callsign for radio communication and coordination is “KUWAIT GROUND.” Their primary duties include overseeing aircraft pushback, engine startup, repositioning, and taxiing on the airport’s surface.

The SMC controller plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient ground operations. This involves coordinating movements to prevent congestion on taxiways and managing the flow of traffic during busy periods. If necessary, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be employed to optimize the sequencing of departures and maintain overall operational efficiency.


## 3.3 Designated Areas of Responsibility

Bahrain only has one Ground position. Therefore, the movement areas are only split between SMC and TWR. TWR controls the runway as well as the holding points and exit taxiways. All other movement areas are under the control of SMC.

Handoffs shall be made in such a way that aircraft are not required to stop taxing. Top control is used on VATSIM. When DLV is not online, SMC will assume its reponsibilities.

Kuwait Ground is responsible for all movement areas on the apron and taxiways up to the holding points, excluding the runway and immediate runway exit taxiways.
