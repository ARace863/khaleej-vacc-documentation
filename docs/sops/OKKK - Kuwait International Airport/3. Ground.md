The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Ground Operations at Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)

## 3.1 General Provisions

Kuwait Ground **(OKBK_GND)** or Surface Movement Control **(SMC)** is responsible for managing surface operations at Kuwait International Airport. The SMC controller’s callsign for radio communication and coordination is “KUWAIT GROUND.” Their primary duties include overseeing aircraft pushback, engine startup, repositioning, and taxiing on the airport’s surface.

The SMC controller plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient ground operations. This involves coordinating movements to prevent congestion on taxiways and managing the flow of traffic during busy periods. If necessary, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be employed to optimize the sequencing of departures and maintain overall operational efficiency.


## 3.2 Designated Areas of Responsibility

Kuwait Ground is responsible for all movement areas on the apron and taxiways up to the holding points, excluding the runway and immediate runway exit taxiways.

Handoffs between SMC and TWR should be executed seamlessly to allow continuous taxi movement, minimizing the need for aircraft to stop. Top down control is applicable here. If Delivery (DLC) is offline, SMC will assume its responsibilities for clearance delivery.

# 4. Procedures

## 4.1 Push-back Procedures

Aircraft handed over from the Ground Movement Planner (GMP) should be fully ready for pushback, having reached their Target Off-Block Time (TOBT). If no obstructions are present, they will be cleared to push back immediately.

::::caution Remember
If an aircraft requesting pushback has an **incorrect transponder code**, they must be instructed to squawk the correct code before proceeding.
::::
Pushback clearances are issued by the Ground Movement Controller (GMC). The direction for pushback is determined primarily by the aircraft's location, runway configuration, and the flow direction of the apron.

## 4.2 Push-back Types and Phraseology

### 4.2.1 Standard Pushback

This is the default type of push back which will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand.

Phraseology:

>Pilot: KAC411, Stand 72, requesting Pushback.

>SMC: KAC411, Push and Start approved, face South, Runway 33L

### 4.2.2 Short Pushback

>Pilot: MSC404, Stand 24, requesting Pushback.

>SMC: MSC404, Short Push and Start approved, face South, Runway 33L

### 4.2.3 Long Pushback

>Pilot: KAC303, Stand 66, requesting Pushback.

>SMC: KAC303, Long Pushback and Startup approved, to finish abeam Stand 72 face South, Runway 33L

### 4.2.4 Conditional Pushback

During high traffic volume, conditional pushback instructions may be issued when an aircraft is taxing behind another traffic aircraft awaiting pushback. This approach ensures a safe cordination and efficient taxiway movement. Whenever applicable, a controller is encouraged to use conditional pushback, as it saves radio time and simplifies the workload.

>Pilot: KAC303, Stand 66, requesting Pushback.

>SMC: KAC303, Behind the company B777, Pushback and Startup approved, face South, Runway 33L
