The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Delivery Operations at Kuwait International Airport (OKKK)

## 2.1 General Provisions

Kuwait Clearance **(OKKK_DEL)** or Delivery Clearance **(DLV)** is responsible for validating flight plans and issuing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This includes thoroughly reviewing the filed route, assigned altitude, and departure procedures to ensure accuracy. If any discrepancies, errors, or invalid information are detected, the controller must correct them before issuing the final clearance.

In addition to route validation, the Delivery Controller plays a crucial role in managing ground operations at Kuwait International Airport. To reduce delays and congestion during peak departure times, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be implemented to conserve fuel and optimize the flow of outbound traffic on the taxiways.
