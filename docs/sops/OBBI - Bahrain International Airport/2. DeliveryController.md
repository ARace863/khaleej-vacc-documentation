The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Delivery Operations at Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)

## General Provisions
Bahrain Clearance **(OBBI_DEL)** or Delivery Clearance **(DLV)** is responsible for validating flight plans and issuing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This includes thoroughly reviewing the filed route, assigned altitude, and departure procedure to ensure accuracy. If any discrepancies, errors, or invalid information are detected, the controller must correct them before issuing the final clearance.

In addition to route validation, the Delivery Controller plays a key role in managing taxiway operations. To reduce delays and congestion during periods of high departure activity, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be implemented to conserve fuel and optimize the flow of outbound traffic on the taxiways.
